# IMPORTANT NEWS 
- The Ice Cube 2.0 bot developement will be completely abandoned in favor of the more polished PW Custom.


# Changelog VER 01 (for the PW Custom)
- Removed "game_fuctions" entirely (it was useless).
- Added "gov" which serves as politics.
- Added "economy" which displays your nation's economy.
- Added "im" AKA Internation Market to buy and sell materials.
- Added "info" to display information about production/consumption of materials.
- Re-added "demolish" to demolish unwanted buildings. (Turns out I accidentally yeeted the command when migrating to cogs.).

# Dev notes:
although i've also added a war command, its not even near done and still needs loads of work.
if you like the project and wanna contribute, please do, every little counts and would lift some of the work of my shoulders and rev's shoulders (hes gonna come back woohoo).


# Changelog VER 02
- Completed the war command.
- Added an admin panel. It's used to manage player data.
- Added a bash script for starting up the bot.
- War command is still not complete...
- Changed SQL tables to now have "name" instead of different ones.
